		<p>Ron Swanson is, in my opinion, best described with a few of his own quotes:
			<ul>
				<li>"When I eat, it is the food that is scared."</li>
				<li>"Just give me all the bacon and eggs you have. Wait... wait. I worry what you just heard was: Give me a lot of bacon and eggs. What I said was: Give me all the bacon and eggs you have. Do you understand?"</li>
				<li>"Son, there is no wrong way to consume alcohol."</li>
				<li>"I've cried twice in my life. Once when I was seven and hit by a school bus. And then again when I heard that Li'l Sebastian had passed."</li>
				<li>"Please, talk more about how you hate Europe and bicycles."</li>
				<li>"Never half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing."</li>
				<li>"I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name, best friend I ever had. We still never talk someetimes."</li>
				<li>"Any dog under 50 pounds is a cat, and cats are pointless"</li>
			</ul>
